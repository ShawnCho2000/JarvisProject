# JarvisProject

Jarvis Project is a project inspired by Tony Stark's Jarvis AI that he is able to control with just his hand movements. This project aims to allow users to feel as if they are using Jarvis by allowing them to control their computers with their hand movements, instead of the traditional mouse and keyboard.
